      <description>A Malay boy was doing his rounds for flag day at the bus interchange. With the can in hand, he paced to and fro between strangers, but most were either oblivious or indifferent. He came forward to lend a helping hand as I was alighting from the bus. I turned around to fish for some coins, but before I knew it, he came back towards me. This time, he offered me a pack of London Choco Roll from his pocket that could have been his morning snack.</description>

      <description>有时候, 我也想重新开始活着, 但难忘的总是纠缠, 遗憾它总是拉扯。身处当下, 心却荡漾在从前。
回不去的依然回头望, 留不住的依旧难分难舍。岁月不留人, 留下情思缠绵, 感今怀昔。</description>

      <description>The pursuit of wealth makes more losses than gains.
The climb for power brings more privation than perks.</description>

      <description>We spend most of our lives searching for someone whom we can count our lives on, but we never really find someone who quite fit the bill because the only person we can count on is, really, yourself.
We spend most of our time seeking somebody whom we can spend the rest of our lives with, but the only one who was there and can be there till the end; at the end, is truly, God himself.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard being a woman

Act like a lady
Look like a young girl
And work like a horse</description>

      <description>Lessons from a Tissue Pack  Greatness is not measured by how much you can gain but how much you can give. Even if it is just tissue paper.
 While on my way to the train station from work, I often meet an affable tissue paper seller who sat along the pavement with her merchandise laid on the ground. Each time I approached, she would flash a toothy smile and gently urged me to get a wheelchair for ease and comfort.</description>
