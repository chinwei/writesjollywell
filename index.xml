      <description>We spend most of our lives searching for someone whom we can count our lives on, but we never really find someone who quite fit the bill because the only person we can count on is, really, yourself.
We spend most of our time seeking somebody whom we can spend the rest of our lives with, but the only one who was there and can be there till the end; at the end, is truly, God himself.</description>

Act like a lady
Look like a young girl
And work like a horse</description>

      <description>Lessons from a Tissue Pack  Greatness is not measured by how much you can gain but how much you can give. Even if it is just tissue paper.
 While on my way to the train station from work, I often meet an affable tissue paper seller who sat along the pavement with her merchandise laid on the ground. Each time I approached, she would flash a toothy smile and gently urged me to get a wheelchair for ease and comfort.</description>
