+++


Kindness begets more kindness.

Suffering breeds deeper suffering.

Suffering dismisses kindness.

Kindness ruins suffering.

Don't let someone suffer because he caused suffering.

Be kind to him so that he learns to be kind.

Because being kind to him is being kind to yourself.

And it ends the suffering of his and of your own
