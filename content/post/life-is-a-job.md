Life is a job!

Our titles are our roles

Our duties are exchangeable

Our conduct is negotiable

Our job scopes are our responsibilities

Our procedure manuals are to-do lists

Our routines are standard operating procedures

Our plans are works in progress

Our goals are key performance indicators

Our remuneration goes beyond dollars and cents

Our benefits are subjected to terms and conditions

Our claims may not get reimbursed

Our promotion is periodical

Our leave days are for sickly days and holidays

Our term is for a lifetime

Our off days are non-existent

HAPPY WORKING! :D
