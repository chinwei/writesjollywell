我想我还是要感谢, 还是会感恩。

那些发生的和没发生的, 我相信有事必有理, 有果必有因。

跌跌撞撞也好, 忐忑不安也罢, 都已是过眼云烟。

我还是会希望明天会更好, 明年会更好。

这不是个总结, 也不是个结束。

是种回味, 某种写照。

I ought to thank, and I am thankful for everything that has happened and did not happen. Things happen for a reason, and there must have been a purpose in how they turned out to be.

I stumbled and fumbled along the way, but all has now come to pass.

I still hope for a better tomorrow, and a better year ahead.

Let this be neither a conclusion nor an end, but altogether, a recollection of reflection and reconciliation.
