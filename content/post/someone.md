We spend most of our lives searching for someone whom we can count our lives on, but we never really find someone who quite fit the bill because the only person we can count on is, really, yourself.

We spend most of our time seeking somebody whom we can spend the rest of our lives with, but the only one who was there and can be there till the end; at the end, is truly, God himself.
