A Malay boy was doing his rounds for flag day at the bus interchange. With the can in hand, he paced to and fro between strangers, but most were either oblivious or indifferent. He came forward to lend a helping hand as I was alighting from the bus. I turned around to fish for some coins, but before I knew it, he came back towards me. This time, he offered me a pack of London Choco Roll from his pocket that could have been his morning snack. His gift may be small but his gesture of grace and goodness was so significant.
