The world isn't what I knew it to be, so I changed along with it.

I thought the world could be what I wanted, so I thought I could change it.

But the more I knew the world, the stranger it became, and the further it seemed.

The more I tried to change the world, the stranger and further I became.

The world didn't change, but I did.

I just knew it.
