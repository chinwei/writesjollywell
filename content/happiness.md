Happiness is never lasting; it has to be renewed.

It begins in you and ends with you; at the moment you cease to feel.

It can be found but it has to be felt;

At its source and in its fruit.

Happiness can be disguised otherwise; until the time to show and tell.

It exists upon invitation; when you

broaden your mind; open your heart or unveil your eyes.

Happiness is a state of mind, a sense of heart; governed by the power of choice.
