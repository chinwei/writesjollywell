<blockquote>
<p>Greatness is not measured by how much you can gain but how much you can give. Even if it is just tissue paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While on my way to the train station from work, I often meet an affable tissue paper seller who sat along the pavement with her merchandise laid on the ground. Each time I approached, she would flash a toothy smile and gently urged me to get a wheelchair for ease and comfort.</p>

<p>I never once made a purchase because there wasn’t a need to. Just the other day, I remembered that my tissue pich was empty and I got my $2 ready in my hand even before I reached her.</p>

<p>She refused my money and readily passed me 5 packets of pocket tissues and 2 packs of travel tissues. I didn’t require so much but she insisted that I keep the money.</p>

<p>I told her there wasn’t enough space in my small banana sling bag and I offered her my sandwich in exchange, but she offered me a plastic bag with a curry puff so I could hold it in my hand.</p>

<p>They say the more you give, the more you’ll get. Sometimes in the most unexpected ways.</p>

<p>She did not have much but she was happy to share what she had. Her gifts were not valuables but the gesture of kindness was invaluable.</p>
